# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using ANN

This project uses **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease, based on key medical attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and more.

The model mimics the learning process of the human brain by using interconnected layers of artificial neurons. It learns patterns from the data and predicts the outcome (heart disease: Yes/No) based on those patterns.

## 🧠 About the Model

- Built using a **basic ANN architecture** with input, hidden, and output layers.
- The network is trained on 13 input features and outputs a binary classification result.
- Technologies used: **Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn**

## 📊 Dataset Information

- The dataset includes **13 medical attributes** such as:
  - Age
  - Sex
  - Chest pain type
  - Resting blood pressure
  - Serum cholesterol
  - Fasting blood sugar
  - Resting ECG results
  - Maximum heart rate achieved
  - Exercise-induced angina
  - ST depression
  - Slope of ST segment
  - Number of major vessels
  - Thalassemia

- **Target column**: Indicates the presence (`1`) or absence (`0`) of heart disease.
